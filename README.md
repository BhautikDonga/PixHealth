# Project: PixHealth (Smart Health Card)

**This project is about making smart health cards for handling centralized data of all medical details and reports.**

We have aadhar card , Pan card, Voter id, Driving licence like identity proofs for our day to day transactions, but we have major missing that is our health card, which manages our day to day health history like disease, allergy etc. And same card is used everywhere in private and public hospitals and clinics, medical store, laboratory to track your health related data , which the concern entity will enter in to the system. This gives very huge and important data analytics using machine learning and AI like City & Area wise allergy or disease etc. This will give on time information to health authority so that , action can be taken on right time and thus it can save many people to become victim of some viral disease. We aim to gather only health related data , so we are not aiming to involve any economical transaction in to the system.

The project has Web, App and Hardware functions. Web module is presented [here](https://github.com/Vatsalparsaniya/PixHealth). Here we are presenting App module by making a Flutter SDK and Firebase real-time database based android/ios application named PixHealth. PixHealth is the application in which a patient can view all the details and past medical history with reports and prescriptions.
